Frontier-Extended=Frontier Extended
[mod-description]
Frontier-Extended=Scenario based on the Frontier scenario originally by MagmaMcFry for 0.14 and MojoD for .16/.17.  This version is much harder than the original and many of the cheats possible have been removed.  To play look for Frontier Extended in Scenarios.  If you wish to move the silo, use the /movesilo <+/-num> command. If you run into problems, /refreshsilo should recreate the silo.
